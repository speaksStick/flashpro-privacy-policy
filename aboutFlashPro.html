  <h1>About Flash Pro</h1>
  <p>Flash Pro is a powerful flashlight app with features like SOS, strobe, Morse code signaling, shake to toggle, and more.</p>
   <h3>Background Limitations</h3> 
  <p> Due to Android system power-saving policies, features like Shake to Switch Torch On/Off may not work reliably when the app has been inactive or running in the background for a long time. Opening the app restores full functionality.</p>
  <p>Version: 1.0.0</p>
  <p>Developed by SpeaksStick.</p>
