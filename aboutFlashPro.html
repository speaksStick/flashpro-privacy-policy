  <h1>About Flash Pro</h1>

  <p>
    Flash Pro is a powerful and easy-to-use flashlight application designed to provide
    advanced lighting features such as SOS, strobe, Morse code signaling,
    shake-to-toggle, pocket protection, and customizable themes.
  </p>

  <h3>Important Notes & Limitations</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Background Behavior:</strong><br>
    Due to Android system power-saving and background execution limits,
    certain features like shake-based torch control may not function
    reliably if the app has been inactive or running in the background
    for an extended period. Opening the app restores full functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pocket Mode:</strong><br>
    Pocket Mode is designed to turn off the flashlight when the device
    is placed face-down or remains stationary. Detection accuracy may
    vary depending on device sensors, orientation, and environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    These behaviors are influenced by device hardware and operating
    system restrictions and may vary across different Android devices.
